World has $M$ distinct ``commodities'' $A, B, \ldots, X$.

Agents in a network. 

The $i^\text{th}$ agent has some number of each commodity, stored as a
vector of counts $\mathbf{n}^i = (n^i_A, n^i_B \ldots )$ with integer
$n^i_X \geq 0$.

The utility for the $i^\text{th}$ agent $U^i = U(\mathbf{n}^i)$. More is good, so this should be monotonically increasing.
But it should ``roll over'' at high counts. I am currently using 
\[
U(\mathbf{n}) = \sum_X \log n_X
\]
which means all commodities are ``essential'', since this diverges at
zero.  All commodities weight equally in this form - there are no
``valuables'' as such.

Each agent makes decisions about which of its neighbours it gifts, and
which commodity is used as a gift.
